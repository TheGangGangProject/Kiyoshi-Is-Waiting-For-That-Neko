*Nico quickly hustled into his house as he was doused by the entourage of rain coming from the outside. He sighed as he look downed at his completely soaked school outfit and started to get some of the clothes off.* "The news said nothing about the rain, just my luck..."

[15-Apr-19 10:43 PM] Bread!#5775
*A male much taller than Nico sprinted in after, making sure to take his shoes off and put his bag down in front of the doorway* “Thanks again- for having me over” *Tohiro Shigata, the man behind Nico, had a big grin on his face and took off his drenched school coat, now being able to see through the white button up shirt he had been wearing under*

[15-Apr-19 10:50 PM] BotManager#3476
*The shorter man turns over to him and gives a simple yet genuine smile, looking at his now visible chest a semi-transparent flush appeared on his cheeks* "I-It's no problem, didn't w-want you to get even more wet than you already a-are."

[15-Apr-19 10:57 PM] Bread!#5775
*with a playful hit on Nico’s back, Tohiro says* “I’m glad your house is closer than mine, I haven’t had time to tidy my room” *he gets a bit flushed from embarrassment but soon shakes it off*

[15-Apr-19 11:05 PM] BotManager#3476
*A tiny yelp escaped Nico's mouth as he was hit, looking away to avoid showing his obvious fluster.* "Y-Yeah... I-I'm gonna t-take a s-shower" *He stops, thinks for a second, and then looks back at Tohiro* "or would you like to?"

[15-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Bread!#5775
“I don’t mind being last, unless you wanna take one together...” *his face lights up like a child’s* “It’ll be like a bathhouse!” *his eyes sparkle as he looks to Nico* “I’ll wash your back if you’d like”

[15-Apr-19 11:12 PM] BotManager#3476
*This thought completely breaks his mind. As his imagination runs rampart and his face becomes an even red, a slow fountain of blood starts to flow down his nose and onto the floor, as he stands completely frozen* “B-b-b-b...”

[15-Apr-19 11:15 PM] Bread!#5775
“Ah! Are you okay!” *Tohiro grabs a tissue from a box on a nearby table and starts to wipe a bit of blood away* “where’s the baths?”

[15-Apr-19 11:20 PM] BotManager#3476
“D-D-Down the h-hall s-second d-door on the right” *The words stumble out as his mind still comprehends the scenario in his mind. Obviously freaking out, he looks over at the other man in a mixture of fear and embarrassment not even knowing that was possible*

[15-Apr-19 11:28 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro runs repeating the location in his mind before they arrive, with the tall boy dragging Nico into the laundry room by the wrist, he begins to unbutton Nico’s shirt* “you’re gonna stain it if you’re not careful. Geez” (btw the laundry room in most Japanese housing is right before the bathing room 😎)

[15-Apr-19 11:33 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico’s heart has started beating fast as it possibly can, skipping a beat or two every so often. With the the currently staggering man taking off his clothes not helping his case as he stands as still as possible while his nose starts to bleed faster*

[15-Apr-19 11:33 PM] BotManager#3476
(You made him so innocent I love it)

[15-Apr-19 11:37 PM] Bread!#5775
*as soon as both their clothing items are removed, Tohiro runs the water and places Nico in the tub* “Are you alright? You sure are losing a lot of blood “ *he grabs a wash rag, dips it in the water every few minutes and gently rubs the blood off of Nico’s nose*

[15-Apr-19 11:38 PM] Bread!#5775
(Ahhhh Ty, also we Stan soft Boy’s like Nico)

[15-Apr-19 11:42 PM] BotManager#3476
“I-I-I’m good, m-must h-have b-been the dryness o-of the air.” *The little male lies horribly as he sits in the warm water, trying to keep the dirty thoughts out of his mind* (Ty we stan)

[16-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro ruffles Nico’s hair and chuckles* “would you like me to wash your back?” *he asks, eagerly anticipating a answer*

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] BotManager#3476
*The flustered male sits and stiffly nods, being the awfully shade of alizarin crimson*

[16-Apr-19 04:59 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro places a stool in front of the shower head and gestures that Nico should come sit down*

[16-Apr-19 05:21 PM] BotManager#3476
*The frail Nico looks over at the stool and nods as he goes to sit down on the stool, still recovering from the nose bleed from earlier.*

[16-Apr-19 05:35 PM] Bread!#5775
*the tall boy applies a lovely scented soap to a wash rag and begins to rub it onto Nico's back as he hums to himself*

[16-Apr-19 05:40 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico sits there as the soap relaxes him into a lulled stated with his eyes getting heavy. Trying to stay up he puts his hands on his knees and he realizes that he is as stiff as board downstairs*

[16-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro keeps at it and soon asks Nico* "do you mind turning on the water to the nozzle?"

[16-Apr-19 05:48 PM] BotManager#3476
"U-U-Uhh Sure!" *He shuffles a bit on the stool and puts his hand over the valve, slowly turning it until a solid jet came out of the shower head*

[16-Apr-19 05:59 PM] BotManager#3476
*and slowly the tapping of warm water and the quite enjoyable massage given courtesy of Tohiro has caused the frail male to go into a lulled sleep*

[16-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro lays his head on Nico’s back to keep warm in the water and laughs playfully*

[16-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Bread!#5775
“Uwah~ the waters so nice” *he says pleased*

[16-Apr-19 09:43 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico sits there with a light almost rhythmic breathing pattern. The boy is fast asleep and there is no sign of him waking up*

[16-Apr-19 09:54 PM] Bread!#5775
*The tall boy notices that Nico is asleep and turns the water off, he props Nico up and is prepared to carry him...... naked*

[16-Apr-19 09:57 PM] BotManager#3476
*The sleepy Nico cradles perfectly into your arms letting a soft whine as he's moved yet still being deep in his wonderland. Soon he tries to grab onto Tohiro's neck softly, sub-consciously trying not to fall*

[16-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Bread!#5775
*Noticing Nico’s [stop don’t touch me there this is my n-] Tohiro blush’s but doesn’t think much of it since he IS asleep, he’s carful caring him as well*

[16-Apr-19 10:19 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico’s thin frame made him quite the light weight and his body was soft and silky with his semi-visible rib cage. He laid there adorable and relaxed almost a 180 to his normally shy and tense attitude*

[16-Apr-19 10:24 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro stares at the thin body he is caring bridle style and begins to tense up for a moment, looking away quickly to hide his deep red face. Soon he’d carried the boy to a room with a wooden carving displaying Nico’s name on it hanging just outside of it*

[16-Apr-19 10:27 PM] BotManager#3476
*The boy shuffled, morning softly, he mumbled incoherency under his breath, his now vibrant eyes fluttering and letting out a surprisingly high pitched yawn*

[17-Apr-19 06:25 PM] BotManager#3476
*he comes to and looks up to see the boy right in his face, causing it to heat up and fluster*

[17-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Bread!#5775
“AH- I’m sorry, I just- you fell asleep and-“ *Tohiro looks away from Nico, flustered*

[17-Apr-19 10:14 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico’s heart had faltered and quickly he started to squirm due to his disorientation. The movement had destabilized his holding and caused him to hug him tighter as if he was holding on for dear life*

[17-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Bread!#5775
“Ah-Nico you’re-!” *he looked down at Nico and let out a small gasp, his breath became hotter and deeper*

[17-Apr-19 10:21 PM] BotManager#3476
*He nuzzled into the middle of his chest, currently not caring about how he looked. This is when his flight or fight response had kicked in and somehow choose freeze instead*

[17-Apr-19 10:29 PM] Bread!#5775
*stiffly Tohiro walked into the room and put Nico on the bed, silent about the situation*

[17-Apr-19 10:32 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico, still frightened, clinged desperately onto him.* “I-I-I’m s-scared of t-the t-t-thunder....” *His now buried face heats up even more* “c-c-c-could-d s-sle-ep with m-m-me”

[18-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Bread!#5775
“Y-YEAH, just lets put some clothes on first!” *he laughs uncomfortably*

[18-Apr-19 10:18 PM] BotManager#3476
*He looked at him and then the realization hit him that he was indeed naked and his face started to go to unbelievable amounts of red.*  "O-O-O-Ok..." *He buries his face into his pillow to hide his flustered expression.*

[19-Apr-19 11:29 PM] BotManager#3476
*After getting over his fluster, Nico quickly gets up and tries to find something to cover himself. Quickly finding a nearby pillow to hide both his embarrassment and his ~~voluptuous cock~~ privates. After that he moves over to his closet quickly picking the things at random and putting them on as swiftly as possible, After putting everything on it was obvious that luck drew him the short straw, being in a shirt two sizes too big and put on backward, having little cat boxers that were just a bit too small, some hounds tooth socks, and worse of all he had somehow had no clean pairs of pants to wear, so he sat there embarrassed in his currently chafing undergarments*

[20-Apr-19 10:04 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro covers his mouth as he takes in the sight* “um, could I borrow some clothes while I wait for mines to dry” *he says muffled by his hand and trying to look away as much as possible, finding his eyes are almost glued to the figure*

[20-Apr-19 10:11 AM] BotManager#3476
*He nods slowly, trying hard for his mind not to stray* “T-Try..., but t-they m-m-might not f-fit...”

[20-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro smiles and gently takes the clothes from him, overlapping their hands a bit, he places on a tight pair of boxers with paw prints printed on them and a plain black shirt over top that slightly showed his stomach due to the size of the clothes. He turned to Nico slightly flustered and thanked him through a smile and a small bow*

[20-Apr-19 10:33 AM] BotManager#3476
*The pure amount of embarrassment, and the exposing outfit he had worn had caused him to just freeze there standing awkwardly. That was until a bout of thunder had shaken the room and had broke him out of his statue like state as he made a mad dash rushing under the cover of the bed and shaking furiously*

[20-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro rushed towards the bed in fear that something may have happened to the other boy. He peaked under the covers and in a soothing voice said* “Nico, it’s just a sound, it can’t hurt you” *he put his hand on Nico’s back above the covers Nico was under*

[20-Apr-19 11:07 AM] BotManager#3476
*He continued to shiver, letting out little squeaks in the process. Then another shock of thunder hit the home causing him to jump and clung to the taller boy as hard as he possibly could laying his face right into the his stomach.*

[20-Apr-19 03:24 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico starts to rub his face directly into Tohiro's surprisingly soft skin, still shaking heavily. He mumbles sweet nothings about how he was a* "...soft pillow...." *nuzzling ~~UWU~~ softly*

[20-Apr-19 07:52 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro hesitates a moment but soon embraced Nico’s small figure, laying down with him* “would you like me to stay until the rain stops?”

[20-Apr-19 07:59 PM] BotManager#3476
*He nods, letting out a sigh of content.* *That was until another shock of plot convenience thunder boomed, again causing the frail boy to jump once again and somehow slithering into the taller mans shirt, now back to his shaking*

[20-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro’s face heats up but he continues to try and comfort Nico*

[20-Apr-19 08:18 PM] BotManager#3476
*Slowly but surely Nico had snaked up his body and was now face to face with him, quietly breathing and nuzzling into the crook of his neck , a feeling of pure bliss plastered on his face*

[21-Apr-19 04:24 AM] Bread!#5775
*He slowly closed his eyes and drifted away to sleep with Nico on his chest, enjoying the warmth he provided*

*The next day was exceptionally bumbling about a certain 2 boys and a photo that had been suposedly been taken during their slumber showing them in an exposed position. Many opinions were formed, the girls fangirling and making them their "OTP", then you had the guys making fun of them and it was awfully rambunctious with rumors*

[21-Apr-19 04:59 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro acted as if it was a normal day and avoided any drama with the situation, he smiled and tried to assure that none of this was true as he walked to homeroom. There he saw Nico sitting in his usual spot by the window* “your head is in the clouds again” *Tohiro smiled and stood looking down at him*

[21-Apr-19 05:12 AM] BotManager#3476
*The frail male looks at him in surprise.* "I guess so..." *He stared out the window once again and lets out a sigh* "All of this drama has caused such a commotion. Hell, I can barely keep my composure"

[21-Apr-19 05:39 AM] joe mama#5224
*Kiyoshi Sato sat at the desk in the back of the class, doodling in a notebook in order to avoid seeming like he didn't have anything to do. He felt very awkward in his manner, as if his very existence was attracting the attention of, was bothering other people.*

[21-Apr-19 05:48 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro noticed Kiyoshi from across the room* “I’ll be right back” *he said to Nico as he walked towards the back of the room. Tohiro stopped at Kiyoshi’s desk and held out his hand with a smile* “Tohiro Shintama”

[21-Apr-19 06:11 AM] joe mama#5224
*Kiyoshi takes a second, processing the fact that he was in fact talked to by a human being.* "U-uwa-ah-ah-" *he blushes hard, recognizing the figure that is in front of him. It's the guy he took a picture of, with that boy...*  "H-h-h-h,,," *he wheezes,* "hi....." *he shrinks a bit into his desk.*

[21-Apr-19 06:14 AM] Bread!#5775
“You okay?” *Tohiro leans in to check the boys face and gets a glimpse of a flushed face*

[21-Apr-19 06:25 AM] joe mama#5224
"Um,, yeah...." *under his breath he scolds himself for handling the situation so poorly.* "yeah. yeah," *he repeats, before taking Tohiro's hand.* "K-K-Kiyoshi Sato."

[21-Apr-19 11:45 AM] BotManager#3476
*Letting out a sigh, Nico walks up to the awkward two and goes up to Tohiro and gives a light smack up the side of his head.* "C'mon, You're gonna give him a heart attack if you keep this up..." *He gave him a look of pure apathy*

[21-Apr-19 08:49 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro smiles and waves at the shy kid, walking away with Nico in the process*

[21-Apr-19 08:59 PM] joe mama#5224
*Sato watches the two leave in confusion, still unsure about why either of them would approach him and if they know that he was the one who took and spread the photo.*

[21-Apr-19 09:08 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico was about to ask Tohiro a question until he stops in his track and looks back at Sato. He goes up to him and looks at his face intently, almost as if he was looking strait through him*

[21-Apr-19 09:11 PM] BotManager#3476
"Wait on a second, you look familiar..." *He pauses for an awkward moment and messes with his hair as if to arrange it in a certain way, then his face light up.* "AH!, you're that kid with good drawings!.... ehhh~ Kiroshi right?"

[21-Apr-19 09:16 PM] joe mama#5224

(Idk maybe like he was trying to reference with an image he had recently seen

[21-Apr-19 09:28 PM] joe mama#5224
(Ah)
*Kiyoshi blushes hard at the boy's touch, practically to the point of nosebleed, but he doesn't flinch away. He nods slowly, rather surprised to be recognized.* "Ah... Yeah... and, t-thank you," *his voice is gentle and  raspy as he hadn't talked in a while, but if he were to put more confidence in his voice it could probably reach Markiplier levels of deep   and smooth.*

[21-Apr-19 09:33 PM] BotManager#3476
*He looks at him and then jolts back a bit* “Ah! Where are my manners...” *He lets out a hand towards him* “The names Nico Chirskov, at your service” *Nico lets out a faint but genuine smile*

[21-Apr-19 10:36 PM] joe mama#5224
"Ah... Nnice to meet you," *he smiles awkwardly, shaking Nico's hand*

[21-Apr-19 10:44 PM] BotManager#3476
*He finally let go of the hand shake and look at his notebook to see the little doodles on it.* “Ohhh~ What do you have here” ~~(the lewds intensify)~~

[21-Apr-19 10:48 PM] joe mama#5224
*he quickly covered the page, an even layer of red ever present on his face* "wa-t-h-These aren't anything," *he closes the notebook quickly* "It's not anything good or, anything,"

[22-Apr-19 07:10 AM] BotManager#3476
*A sinister smirk crept onto his face, giving him a grim atmosphere.* “Well~, If it’s nothing then you should have no problem showing me. Maybe you’re hiding something?” *He slowly travels his index finger down the side of his face*

[22-Apr-19 09:58 PM] joe mama#5224
"Ah- of course not!" *he blushes even harder than what normal human beings would consider physically possible as he tensely holds the book between his arms, obviously hiding something.* "It's just... you wouldn't like it..." *his voice gets smaller as his anxiety levels get bigger. This boy must know something, right? or else he wouldn't....*

[22-Apr-19 10:02 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico's grin grew ear to ear* "Hmmmm, I wouldn't like it?" *He gets right next to his face almost breathing down his neck.* "You don't even now what I like!" *He blinks slowly and starts to lick the side of his face tasting the salty sweat on it.* "That, Kiyoshi Sato, is the taste of a true liar." *He puts his hand on the table slowly prying his hands from the book.*

"Now then.... What's in the book~"

[22-Apr-19 10:11 PM] joe mama#5224
*The boy, weak from nervousness, loses grip on his book almost immediately. He breathed heavily, from both nervousness and possibly something else...? He doesn't respond to the assertive, teasing boy's question, only standing in defeat as he realizes he can't do anything to hide himself. He was exposed just like that, and it turned him on, if he was being honest. He'd always loved Nico from a distance, and seeing him take control like this wasn't unlike certain fantasies he'd had-contained within the book his crush now had in his hands. The book that also contained edgy poems, plenty of lewd drawings, and worst of all, his notes on Nico and the photos he's taken of him- as well as the photo that had spread around the school that he took yesterday... If Nico looked closely enough, his life would be ruined, just like this... what a sudden, tragic way to go, he thought.*

[22-Apr-19 10:19 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico grab's the book looking at it intently flipping through every page intently reading every word that was scrawled on it and looked at some of the drawings intently, judging it with eyes of ice.* "You know what, you're quiet the poet. It's quite the feat to write a engrossing and flowing story with obvious moral in a didactic..." *He flips through the last few pages, and stops on one with a paper clip attached to it.* "As I thought, that cute face of yours hides quite the few lies." *He takes out what was attached to show the exposing photo* "I mean, I'm not mad but you have interested me..."

*He looks dead straight at Sato, a heart of pure ice can be seen reflected through his eyes* "See, I don't care that you took the photo, that's not the problem here. What is the why and how of the photo" *He takes it out and props it between his index and middle finger shaking it slightly*

[22-Apr-19 10:28 PM] joe mama#5224
"A-ah... t-t-that's....!" *beads of sweat drop down onto the desk as he turns his head back up. He doesn't make eye contact, rather, he's focused on the picture Nico now had in his hand. He already saw the intent in Nico's eyes as he flipped through every page, and if he saw it directed at him now he would feel even more like the boy's prey, and it would be harder to avoid showing his own arousal at the deeply embarassing moment....* "I m-m-mean...."

[22-Apr-19 10:31 PM] BotManager#3476
*He flicks the photo towards him spinning wildly. Quickly, it whizzed past the boys ear and lodged it self a half inch into the wall behind him* "Well..." *This quickly got the remaining class mates to look at the three in wild amusement*

[22-Apr-19 10:33 PM] Bread!#5775

[22-Apr-19 10:34 PM] joe mama#5224
*he flinches as the photo's thrown past him, his panic increasing tenfold. he bites his lip as a cliched fantasy intrudes his thoughts, of being pinned against the wall by the boy.* "I didn't... I mean, I d-d-d-*did* take it, I.... I've been..." *his thoughts are clear yet jumbled together as he tries to explain, the words caught in his throat. He would rather be anywhere else, yet he wanted to stay so badly within the cat's grasp as a mere mouse.*

*he sees the anger in Tohiro's eyes and almost feels like crying. The only person he could possibly take anger from is Nico, not Nico's friend. But at this point he would rather get this over with.* "Okay..." *he stands up, but his legs are weak, so he holds onto the desk, at this point very concerned about how hard Nico had made him possibly less than how threatened he felt by Tohiro or what might happen to him.*

*As Tohiro dragged Kiyoshi into the supply closet by the front of his shirt, he kept a poker face on* “there’s two ways we can do this,” *he shoved Kiyoshi on the back wall*

[22-Apr-19 10:58 PM] Bread!#5775
“Either you get on your hands and knees, beg and we do as we please with you or...” *he leans into Kiyoshi’s ear* “I throw you to the ground and beat the shit out of you”

(bruh since when did you guys become such doms

*Sato whimpers, still redder than a bag of doritos, tense against Tohiro's touch. He couldn't help it, the situation... was scary and hot at the same time. he stayed silently until he got onto his knees, kowtowing to the pair.* "I-I'm sorry... Do whatever you want.. I'm yours." *he added the last part with a slight, unintended seduction.*

[22-Apr-19 11:15 PM] Bread!#5775

[22-Apr-19 11:39 PM] joe mama#5224

*Kiyoshi nods softly, the harshness of the boy making his lust even stronger.*

*The male lays on the floor gasping in pain, tossing from side to side in agony.  Meaty crunches of bone ring out as he tries to suppress his screams by biting into his arm, drawing blood. Slowly but surely two fluffy brown ears about 3 inches in length sprout from the top of his head wriggling similar to a newborn. While throwing his body around an even louder* ***SNAP*** *was heard causing Nico to jolt away from his arm and let out a blood curdling scream that could have shattered mirrors. A long curly brown and white tipped tail about 2 feet in length had sprung out of his jeans like a newborn sapling climbing to the skies above. The odd thing, as soon as it came, the pain left, leaving Nico a gasping and shaking mess on the floor as a puddle of saliva starts to pool under him as blood trickled down the bite marks on his arm.*

(poor boy, why do I do this to him)

[24-Apr-19 09:37 PM] BotManager#3476
*Slowly but surely Nico’s breath steadies and slows to its normal pace. He looks pleadingly at the other two with a look that tried to say ‘help me’ but instead said ‘fuck me’. He looks down at his hands in despair and then at his new tail that was sprawled around his waist letting out a quiet and raspy voice* “W-What-t h-happened-d?”

[24-Apr-19 09:48 PM] BotManager#3476
*But then again he starts to shake, as if a magnitude 5 was hitting him. His ears then started to grow bigger and bigger and now being a solid 7 inches tall.  He finally breaks, starting to cry as he let out of all of his pent up confusing like a river damn* “M-Momm-my~!I-I-I w-want-t-t to g-go home!” *he cries out letting the river of tears flow as the requiem plays softly from the nearby band room*

[25-Apr-19 10:04 PM] BotManager#3476

*Nico choked and gagged as he looked up to the other shy and blushing boy standing in front of him. It took him a while for a the dots to connect, but when they did his face went from a faint red to stop sign in a few seconds, but there was an odd feeling settled down in the pits of his stomach. A seed of lust for the other boys member had been sown into him and there was no way to get it out.*

*Tohiro's legs quiver a bit as he bites his lip slowly resting his left hand on Nico's head*

[01-May-19 08:53 PM] BotManager#3476
*His still new ears twitch a bit as his hand made contact with his hair. Letting that aside Nico slowly started to bob is head back and forth trying to cover every crevice of the boys strong member in his mouth, successfully fitting the whole thing in his mouth*

[01-May-19 09:31 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro shakes uncontrollably while a mischievous smile was still across his face and then pushed forcefully a bit on Nico’s head* “you’re so” *Tohiro grunts in pleasure* “cute y-you know that Nico”

[02-May-19 12:16 AM] BotManager#3476
*Those few words sent him spiraling. Blushing, he picked up the pace and started to move faster and faster, his tail wagging erratically*

[02-May-19 10:59 PM] BotManager#3476
*He pushes harder and tougher as he quickens his pace. Getting sloppier with each stroke, he finally grows stiff. With a giant bulge now forming in his pants he starts to moan.*

[02-May-19 11:03 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro isn’t able to contain himself anymore and releases his load with a sinful expression on his face*

[02-May-19 11:08 PM] BotManager#3476
*Using his cum as a sign, Nico slowly stops bobbing and backs to look up at him. He licks his lips as his eyes widen with a child like brightness.* “I-It t-tastes l-like str-rawberries.” *He wags his tail as he slowly but surely tries to get up but ends up exposing his rock hard 9 incher*

[07-May-19 05:56 PM] BotManager#3476
*As everyone stood in the cramped closet, a faint noise grew louder from outside the hall. Someone was coming*

[07-May-19 06:24 PM] joe mama#5224
*Sato was turned to the sound tensely, almost as if he was a rabbit. What if it was someone he knew? How could he deal if he was seen like this, with a pouring nosebleed and boner over his-now catlike, he noted, which was even cuter-crush?*
(Oh god oh f what if the person's coming because of Nico's screams from earlier,

Seeing a mass of students roaming around the halls and talking amongst them selves.* "T-This might be a bit cliché but we maybe I c-could hide s-some kind of cart..." *He turns back to the closet and looks around for some objects of use. Diving head first into a pile of props, rummaging about and letting his rear and legs flail around.*

[08-May-19 06:27 PM] joe mama#5224
*Sato realizes he can't just sit there and swoon over Nico, so he joins in looking for the props*

[08-May-19 06:32 PM] BotManager#3476
*He comes back up with a few costumes and a industrial laundry basket. Looking over at Tohiro and back at the costume* "Say~, Tohiro how about dressing up as a janitor.."

*Tohiro laughs and then realizes Nico is being completely serious. he clears his  throat and looks at the other boy slightly pissed* "fine" *He groans*

[08-May-19 08:43 PM] BotManager#3476
"Good!" *Smirking, he tosses the clothing at the boy and looks at the laundry cart.* "It's gonna be bit of a squeeze, but me and you should fit in this cart." *He looks over at the other boy with a genuine smile as his ears perk up.*

[08-May-19 08:53 PM] joe mama#5224
*Sato died on the spot, and offered an awkward smile back while he wished he could take a picture. His eyes widened slightly as he realized he'd be crammed in a tight space with the adorable boy...* "Aaa...a-alright." *He tried not to seem so lovestuck even though the boy already knew his feelings at this point... oh god oh f oh god oh f oh god-he forgot about everything the boy learned about him, the pictures, the poems and drabbles, even the stolen underwear-
...he goes to get in the cart.*

[08-May-19 09:02 PM] BotManager#3476
*Without a word, Nico squeezes into cart and grabs a nearby assortment of towels and puts them on top. After a bit of awkward shuffling later, the boy situates himself lying his head on the other boys chest. Wrapping an arm around his waist, the tail around his thighs, and intertwining his legs into his to maximize space and set him off. He slowly lowers all of the towels onto them as he is now nearly face to face with Sato.*

His member was hard against Nico's leg as he practically breaks his neck in order to kiss Nico on the forehead, wrapping his arms around the boy and gripping passionately onto his shirt. Maybe it was too soon, but he didn't care.*

*The three enter the hotel as Nico goes up the receptionist and pulls out what looks like an ID card.* "I need a room for three, and make it a LL Suite...." *Then his face gets stern as he pulls out a odd card with a red pattern on it from his wallet.* "and give this to the manager and tell him it's from Renoch, he'll pay for the room..."

[08-May-19 10:25 PM] BotManager#3476
*The receptionist simply nods and give him the key cards and goes through the normal speech about breakfast hours and stuff. He walks off to the other two, and gives them a key.* "The room is 602, We should probably get going before anyone notices we are here." *His entire aura has changed from a shy and childish to a stern adult one.*

[08-May-19 10:31 PM] Bread!#5775
*The two boys followed behind him* “So, uh,” *Tohiro clears his throat as he gets flustered* “if I’m correct this is... a- a lo-love hotel” *Tohiro gulps*

[08-May-19 10:34 PM] joe mama#5224
*Sato whispers to himself that he should write all this down later. He knew more about his crush than he let on, but this is... an experience. He'd rather keep quiet and see what happens.*

[08-May-19 10:35 PM] joe mama#5224
(the hard part about writing sato is that he's literally a spectator)

[08-May-19 10:35 PM] Bread!#5775

(Sad, yet good)
*The man gives a smirk and gives him a stern look.* "Precisely, that's why I choose this place. The last place you would look for a couple of good-mannered teens would be in a place for adults." *He walked into the elevator and pressed the glossy 6 button.*

[08-May-19 10:37 PM] joe mama#5224
"I wouldn't call us good-mannered...." *Kiyoshi half-mumbles, following him into the elevator.*

[08-May-19 10:39 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro thinks for a minute* “woah, that’s really smart” *when they pile into the elevator Tohiro tugs on his shirt* “I-is it hot in here or what” *He says awkwardly*

[08-May-19 10:39 PM] Bread!#5775
*his face is flushed almost as if he were drunk*

[08-May-19 10:42 PM] BotManager#3476
"Hmm, So it seems..." *He gave an odd look at them as he straightened out his new ears. Giving him an idea for later.*

[08-May-19 10:43 PM] joe mama#5224
*Kiyoshi glares at Tohiro, too lost in thought to speak despite paying full attention. With his arms crossed, he writes his thoughts onto his elbow with his pointer finger.*

[08-May-19 10:43 PM] joe mama#5224
(bro aphrodisiacs)

[08-May-19 10:45 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro notices Kiyoshi’s stare and through hot, heavy panting, winks*

[08-May-19 10:46 PM] BotManager#3476
*The group stood in the elevator until it hit the 6th floor and let out a tiny ringing noise.* "It should be on the left...." *He walks out into the hallway*

[08-May-19 10:51 PM] Bread!#5775
*They progress to the room*

[08-May-19 10:54 PM] BotManager#3476
*Opening the door reveals the room to be quite the sight. It was an average hotel room but with a lavish pink heart shaped bed, and many  'toys' behind it.* "These rooms were originally made for a condo but were turned into a love suite...." *He travels a bit into the room and lets the other two enter. As he pours some, 'water' for them.*

[08-May-19 10:57 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro takes a seat amazed by the assortment of ‘toys’, nothing like the ones he had at home (😳) he sat and drank what was given to him without a second thought*

[08-May-19 10:58 PM] joe mama#5224
"I see." *he turns his gaze over the room slowly before taking a seat a small distance from Tohiro. he can smell the alcohol as he takes a sip.
he still drinks it without a care.*

[08-May-19 10:59 PM] Bread!#5775
(Choose you’re alcoholic time!)

[08-May-19 11:00 PM] Bread!#5775
(Tohiro is most definitely aggressive/ sexual 🕵️‍♂️)

[08-May-19 11:02 PM] BotManager#3476
(yeas)*He takes in their actions with intrigue as he continues to explain.* “and the owner of this place is the big boss of the mafia around these parts....I knew him when I worked as his go to executioner. But that’s past me now”

[08-May-19 11:02 PM] joe mama#5224
(uhh I'm gonna go for "alcohol cures anxiety, check this out I'm confident now but also delirious")

[08-May-19 11:02 PM] Bread!#5775
(Lmao)

[08-May-19 11:04 PM] joe mama#5224
"an executioner? huh.... how long ago?" *he tilted his head slightly in an almost catlike manner, leaning back in his chair.*

[08-May-19 11:04 PM] joe mama#5224
(oops wrong tense dont care)

[08-May-19 11:05 PM] BotManager#3476
*Looking out into space he thinks for a bit as he thinks aloud.* “Would have to been like 7 years ago maybe more...”

[08-May-19 11:07 PM] joe mama#5224
"...how old are you, again?" *he asks, before laughing a bit too hard at his own joke.*
(wait how old is he for real like 17 right so wtf)

[08-May-19 11:08 PM] BotManager#3476
(His first kill was when he was 5 so yeah)

(with tribes

[08-May-19 11:11 PM] BotManager#3476
*He gives a bit of a chuckle and lets out a sigh. Slowly he gets up and grabs a bottle from the cabinet.* “Shit the only whiskey they got it fireball, come on Soren give me the good shit for once.” *He complains as he open the bottle and takes a swig.*

[08-May-19 11:17 PM] BotManager#3476
*Nico gives a glance to the others* “Hey how are you two? Did the vodka set in by now?”

[08-May-19 11:18 PM] joe mama#5224
"Probably." *he shrugs nonchalantly.*

[08-May-19 11:21 PM] BotManager#3476
“Ok then let’s try this...” *He slowly sinks his canines into Sato’s soft neck letting the blood drip a bit*

[08-May-19 11:24 PM] joe mama#5224
"Ah.. that stings a bit, but it's also *very* hot," *he says softly, and wraps his arm around Nico, gently running his fingers through the boy's hair on impulse.*

[08-May-19 11:25 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro bites the nail on his thumb as he watches*

[09-May-19 07:37 AM] BotManager#3476
*Looking over at Tohiro, he gives him a seductive stare as continues to lick the blood coming out of Sato’s neck.* “Don’t be shy big boy~ There’s plenty of room just for you...” *He then traces his finger down Sato’s cheek to his fly, unzipping it in the process.*

[09-May-19 07:38 AM] BotManager#3476
(~~I feel like I shouldn’t need to explain what a fly is but if you don’t know it’s that zipper that allows your dick to poke out~~)

[09-May-19 11:25 AM] joe mama#5224
"Well? I'm yours," *he purred, waiting to see what Nico had in mind for him*
(Trash response 🤠😃🤠😃🤠😃)

[09-May-19 05:10 PM] BotManager#3476
*Quickly, he unclothes the boy and looks at his already hard member.* "Hmph, just like last time~~.." *Suddenly he dive mouth first onto his cock and starts to bob violently.*

[09-May-19 06:44 PM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro moves closer to the two and begins to get grabby with Nico, squeezing his thighs*

[09-May-19 09:54 PM] joe mama#5224
*Sato sharply inhales, trembling slightly. With one eye closed from his tenseness, he puts his hand on top of Nico's head with a slight pat.* "Fuck...." *he mutters*

[09-May-19 10:00 PM] BotManager#3476
*He continues to bob up and down at a sickening speed, letting his toungue slop around his tip.*

[09-May-19 11:42 PM] BotManager#3476
*He lets his own cock harden as he moves his fingers down behind Sato and slowly starts to insert a finger in his ass, like Kanye west.*

*Currently a very flustered and obviously very uncomfortable neko stands out in the hall. Panting heavily, he presses a cold water bottle to his forehead.* "God, why now. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE NOW!??"

[28-Jul-19 01:26 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro noticing Nico quickly catches up and throws arm around the boy and asks in a friendly manner* "So, Nico, we still up for walking home together!"

[28-Jul-19 01:27 AM] joe mama#5224
*the aforementioned uncomfortable neko's stalker stares from behind a wall*

[28-Jul-19 01:29 AM] Bread!#5775
"They just opened up this new sweet store and I was thinking we could go together I just need an excuse to eat sweets honestly..."

[28-Jul-19 01:31 AM] BotManager#3476
"Uwaahh! O-Oh y-yes..." *Nico jumps in suprise as he accidentally throws his water bottle. His face now a mix of embarrassment and a very deep pink.*

[28-Jul-19 01:33 AM] Bread!#5775
"eh, whats wrong you catch a fever or something?" *Tohiro places both his and Nico's foreheads together*

[28-Jul-19 01:36 AM] BotManager#3476
*The contact makes his face grow a shade darker, while the touch reveals that he's burning up.*

[28-Jul-19 01:38 AM] Bread!#5775
"Nico! you need to get to the nurses office now! I'll walk you," *He grabs Nico by the arm*

[28-Jul-19 01:39 AM] joe mama#5224
*Kiyoshi writhes over the two's closeness, tempted to come over yet nervous about talking to either of them*

[28-Jul-19 01:40 AM] BotManager#3476
"I-I'm fi-" *The grasp had sent a shock through his system, causing him to collapse right there and then.*

[28-Jul-19 01:43 AM] joe mama#5224
"Nico-" *throwing away his hesitation, he ran over to the boy's side* "a-are you okay?"

[28-Jul-19 01:46 AM] Bread!#5775
"Nico!" *Tohiro falls to the floor to check on the small boy*"Nico, sorry for this!" *Tohiro picks Nico up supperised at how light he was* "you, kid!" *he jesters towards Kiyoshi* "could you hold his things and grab that water bottle" *Tohiro smiles at him sweetly*

[28-Jul-19 01:51 AM] joe mama#5224
"ehhh- of- of course!" *he quickly picked up the other boy's things*

*The two rushed to the nurses office but, alas (lol), no nurse on duty* "just our luck" *Tohiro places Nico on one of the beds*

[28-Jul-19 01:56 AM] BotManager#3476
*A inaudible and raspy whisper came slowly out of lips. He looks up at the boy and give him a slight smile before his eyes slowly shut.*

[28-Jul-19 02:05 AM] joe mama#5224
*kiyoshi nodded. he grabbed a rag, ,ran it over some cold water at the nearest sink and gave it to the other boy*

[28-Jul-19 02:07 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro nodded with a smile as to thank the boy then placed the cloth on Nico's forehead* "So, you know Nico?"

[28-Jul-19 02:10 AM] joe mama#5224
"....you could say that," *he said, fidgeting*

[28-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Bread!#5775
"I haven't seen you much around Nico... anyways, I'm Tohiro. me and Nico are close so if you wanna ask me something I'm here, any friend of Nico's is a friend of mine" *Tohiro placed his hand out for a handshake*

[28-Jul-19 02:16 AM] joe mama#5224
"ah...... yeah," *he shook the boy's hand* (bleh bleh ble p bleel)

[28-Jul-19 02:18 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro, having no sense of boundaries leand into Kiyoshi's face* "and you are?"

[28-Jul-19 02:20 AM] joe mama#5224
"k-kiyoshi," *he said, backing away from tohiro.* "kiyoshi sato."

[28-Jul-19 02:24 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro puts on a big smile and makes a cute noise* "alright! anyways Kiyoshi do you mind sitting down and watching Nico while I look through these medicine cabinets?"

[28-Jul-19 02:30 AM] joe mama#5224
"...alright," *he sits down and immediately regrets like half of what he just said*

[28-Jul-19 02:31 AM] Bread!#5775
*Tohiro hastily looks through the cabinets*

[28-Jul-19 02:34 AM] BotManager#3476
*Nico lets out a loud groan as he throws he body from side to side in anguish but slowly dies down once again resting his body onto Kiyoshi's*

[28-Jul-19 02:41 AM] joe mama#5224
"eehhh-!" *kiyoshi's face turns a deep red at the sight of nico asleep on him* "c-cute..." *he whispers to himself* (Bleh lbeh pblep hlbephllalblhlelhllbleap)

[28-Jul-19 02:44 AM] Bread!#5775
"found it!" *Tohiro shouts and hands the bottle to Kiyoshi* "could you make sure he swallows this?"

[28-Jul-19 02:50 AM] BotManager#3476
*The shouting had caused him to get riled up again. Starting to toss and turn in the bed his movements started to get very sporadic.*
